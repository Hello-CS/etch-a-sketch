# etch-a-sketch

Creating a sketchpad

Link: https://hello-cs.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

Things Learnt:

1. Grid manipulation
2. JS control over CSS variables
3. JS control over HTML
4. EventListener types
5. Color randomization

Had fun doing this mini project. Would love to add further color randomization per mouse over rather than per session.
